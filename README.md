# gce.py

A Discord bot for executing code using a variety of sources.

## Hosting

To host, just make a file called `token.txt` and place the bot token in it. As the bot host, you gain access to Jishaku through `gce!jsk`.

## Invite

You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=709333181983096834&permissions=0&scope=bot).

It requires the permissions Read Messages and Send Messages to work, and also wants Attach Files for sending long responses.
